# Machine Learning and AI @ SSN Coding Club

This repository contains all resources and code used in the Coding Club ML sessions. This will be updated periodically. The resources for each meet can be found in their respective folders.

## Meets:
1. Intro to ML - Roadmap and Scope (19/07/2021)


## Resources for learning ML:

An extensive roadmap can be found [here](https://whimsical.com/machine-learning-roadmap-2020-CA7f3ykvXpnJ9Az32vYXva).

#### Math

For starting out in ML, basic background in linear algebra and statistics (probability distribution, Bayes' rule etc.) should suffice.

#### Miscellaneous

* [Neural networks and deep learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) - Best resource for understanding deep learning fundamentals from scratch, with code.
* [Neural networks playlist by 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) - Visualising how neural networks work and learn from data.

## Upcoming Sessions:

Tentatively, the upcoming sessions will focus on teaching core ML concepts, building simple ML models, understanding how to analyse and improve their performance, why deep learning is needed, the current state of ML research and how ML models are deployed.
